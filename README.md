# fhir-server
A fast, open source, HL7 FHIR server

This project provides [HL7 FHIR DSTU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/index.html) models and a generic FHIR server implemented in Go and using MongoDB as storage. This is not a complete implementation, as it is tuned toward the primary use cases of the [Intervention Engine](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie), [eCQM Engine](https://github.com/mitre/ecqm), [Patient Matching Test Harness](https://github.com/mitre/ptmatch)
 +and [Synthetic Mass](https://github.com/synthetichealth/syntheticmass) projects.

The code in this project is a small wrapper around the [FHIR Server Library](https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir).

## Building and Running fhir-server Locally
To install the FHIR server, please begin by referencing the following sections of the Intervention Engine install guide:

- (Prerequisite) [Install Git](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-git)
- (Prerequisite) [Install Go](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-go)
- (Prerequisite) [Install MongoDB](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#install-mongodb)
- (Prerequisite) [Run MongoDB](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#run-mongodb)
- Clone this repository into your GOPATH

Before you can run the FHIR server, you must install its dependencies via `go get` and build the `fhir` executable:

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mitre/fhir-server
$ go get
$ go build
```

The above commands do not need to be run again unless you make (or download) changes to the *fhir* source code.

Once the executable is built, you can run it without any arguments:

```
$ ./fhir-server
```

If you are concurrently modifying the *fhir* source code, sometimes it is easier to combine the build and run steps into a single command (forcing a recompile on every run):

```
$ go run server.go
```

The *fhir* server accepts connections on port 3001 by default.

If you wish to test the server with synthetic patient data, please reference [Generate and Upload Synthetic Patient Data](https://github.com/intervention-engine/ie/blob/master/docs/dev_install.md#generate-and-upload-synthetic-patient-data).
